# gerbmerge-1.8

January 2015

Repo for modifications to gerbmerge 1.8 used in the Biomimetic Millisystems Lab at UC Berkeley for panelizing PCBs.

Found setup.py modifications here: https://karplus4arduino.wordpress.com/tag/gerbmerge/

Before installing gerbmerge, be sure to install the SimpleParse package for Python.
I successfully installed SimpleParse by running:
pip install simpleparse

After downloading this repo, cd to directory containing setup.py and run:
python setup.py install

After a successful installation, you should be able to type gerbmerge into your terminal and see documentation.
